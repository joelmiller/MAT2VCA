# The Laplace Transform

We begin this subject with an introduction to the Laplace Transform.  The Laplace Transform is not actually a tool of Vector Calculus.  However, it is an important tool of applied mathematics, particularly within Engineering.  Because the second-year engineering subjects rely on the Laplace Transform, it is taught at the beginning of this subject.

We will use the Laplace Transform to convert constant coefficient linear differential equations into algebraic problems which we will then solve using techniques from algebra.  Typically differential equations show up in cases where things are changing.  For example: the position of a child riding a swing, the concentration of a toxin in the blood,
