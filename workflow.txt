The instructions below were created for MAT2VCA
update names as appropriate.



# Creating initial folders etc:
- run jupyterbook stuff etc to get starting files in place.
  - if github repository already created 
    go into the repository and run 
    
    jupyter-book create MAT2VCA
    
  - This will create a subdirectory MAT2VCA
    where all the text files (.md, .ipynb) will sit.
    Later the html files will be in a folder called
    docs which will sit at the same level as MAT2VCA
    You may prefer to just call it `mybook`

  - I have stored the notebooks in a subdirectory of
    the folder containing the .md files whose name is
    notebooks.  It may be better to not create this
    subdirectory.  A decision for a later time, I guess.


- at first time uploading be sure to set up .gitignore
  - Should ignore 
    - _build
    - *.log
  - if using repository template, need to unignore:
    - *html
    - docs

- ensure files are added to github repository.

<at this step look further below and do steps to build book>

- go to github under settings find pages
  set up to use master/docs 
  check url where things appear

- Formatting is probably bad on first attempt
  - edit _config.yml by adding 
          baseurl: /MAT2VCA/ 
    under the html block.
    [add explanatory comment to yml file]


#ADDING NEW CHAPTER ETC:

- Put new file in MAT2VCA
  - if a notebook, put into MAT2VCA/notebooks
- Add details to _toc


#COMPILE - follow instructions below each time
# In vscode terminal go to folder and build book

- jupyter-book build MAT2VCA

Now it is built in _build/html

# remove docs directory if not first time 
# (otherwise it may refuse to overwrite files with new versions).

rm -r docs

#move directory _build/html to docs

mv _build/html docs
